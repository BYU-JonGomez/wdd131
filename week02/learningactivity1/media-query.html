            <h2>Mosiah 3:19</h2>
            <p>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, ferever and ever,
                unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh
                a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble,
                patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.

            <h2>Alma 17:3</h2>
            <p>But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they
                had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power
                of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority od God.
